A rating system for the mobile game Clash of Clans. In the game you have troops, heroes, spells, and siege machines to attack other players
in the game. This system will take your troops and their level and give you a score based on those levels and based on the importance of
the troops for your town hall in the game. Some troops are more important than others at specific town halls and that causes troops to
have different weights. An example is the Hog Rider troop is more important at town halls 8,9,10 as compared to 11,12,13 so they have higher
weights at the lower town halls. These weights were determined by looking at the top 5 most used army compositions at town halls 8-13 as this 
rating system is only for Town Halls >= 8. 

In the rating system the user first picks whether they want it in solo mode or war mode. In solo mode they provide one player tag and then 
the system returns a score for that single player and then terminates. In war mode they are asked to provide the war size (5v5,10v10,15v15,
20v20,25v25,30v30,35v35,40v40,45v45,50v50) and then are asked to provide the tags for each team and calculates the score for each player.
Once all players have been provided it shows the matchups for the war so the person can better determine a war strategy if the war is 
unbalanced, fair etc.
